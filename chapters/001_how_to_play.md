# How To Play

## Rolling

Each time you are asked to roll, either by the GM, or by a move, you will be told a Stat and a Skill. Add these numbers together from your character sheet. Roll a d12, if you roll _under_ that number, that is a __success__. If you roll _above_ the target number, that is a __failure__. 

## Drive

Whenever you succeed on a roll to perform a task, you earn 1 __Drive__. __Drive__ is a pool that is used by your party. You can spend __Drive__ to roll more d12s to try and succeed on a task. However, a successful task only ever yields 1 __Drive__.

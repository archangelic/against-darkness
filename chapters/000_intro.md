# Introduction

> Tales of knights, and righteous adventurers have come and gone. Magicka still permeates the mundane world. It's been condensed, and industrialized, but it still exists. But even in this time of technology, information, and enlightenment, a darkness grows that threatens it all.

Against Darkness is a game set in any setting where magic exists alongside modern technology. The game is played with 4 players: 3 players and 1 Narrator. The players play characters (see: The Parts of You) that are striving to save their world from darkness.

The narrator is the one who tells the whole story, determines the consequences of actions taken by the Players, and plays all non-player characters. (see: TODO)
